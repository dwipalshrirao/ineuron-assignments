1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

ans:
    The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False. They can be written as True and False, 
    respectively.
---------------------------------------------------

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

ans:
    The three different types of Boolean operators are:
    and: Returns True if both operands are True.
    or: Returns True if either operand is True.
    not: Returns the opposite of the operand.
-------------------------------------------------------

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

ans:
    The truth tables for the Boolean operators are:
    Operator	               Answer
    ......................................
        and	    True	False   False
        and	    True	True    True

        or	    True	True    True
        or	    True	False    True
        or	    False	False    False

        not	    False	          True
        not	    True	          False
--------------------------------------------------------

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

ans: 
    The values of the expressions are:

    Expression	                        Answer
    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)	            False
    not (5 > 4)	                        False
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)         	    True
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))   	    False
    (True and True) and (True == False)	False
    (not False) or (not True)	        True
--------------------------------------------------------

5. What are the six comparison operators?

ans:
    The six comparison operators are:

    ==: Equal to
    !=: Not equal to
    >: Greater than
    <: Less than
    >=: Greater than or equal to
    <=: Less than or equal to
--------------------------------------

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition 
    and when you would use one.

ans:
    The equal to operator == is used to compare two values and return True if they are equal. 
    The assignment operator = is used to assign a value to a variable.

    For example, the following code will assign the value 10 to the variable spam:
    spam = 10

    The following code will compare the values of the variables `spam` and `eggs`:
    if spam == eggs:
        print("spam and eggs are equal")
-------------------------------------------

7. Identify the three blocks in this code: 

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
if spam &gt; 5:
    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')

ans: 
    The three blocks in the code are:

    The first block is the if block that is executed if the value of spam is equal to 10.
    The second block is the if block that is executed if the value of spam is greater than 5.
    The third block is the else block that is executed if the value of spam is not equal to 10 and not greater than 5.
------------------------------------------

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, 
and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

ans:
    The following code will print Hello if 1 is stored in spam, Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and
    Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam:

    spam = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if spam == 1:
        print("Hello")
    elif spam == 2:
        print("Good Morning")
    else:
        print("Good Afternoon!")
------------------------------------------------

9.If your program is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

ans:
    press Ctrl + C
-----------------------------------------------

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

ans:
    The break statement terminates the current loop, while the continue statement skips the rest of 
    the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration.

    For example, the following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it will stop after printing 
    the number 5:

    for i in range(1, 11):
        if i == 5:
            break
        print(i)

    The following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it will skip the number 5:
    for i in range(1, 11):
        if i == 5:
            continue
        print(i)
------------------------------------------------------

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

ans:
    The range() function returns a sequence of numbers. The three arguments to the range() function are:

    The start value
    The stop value
    The step value
    The default value for the start value is 0. The default value for the step value is 1.

    The following code will print the numbers from 0 to 9:

    for i in range(10):
        print(i)


    The following code will print the numbers from 1 to 10:

    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)


    The following code will print the numbers from 0 to 9, but it will skip every other number:

    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
        print(i)
--------------------------------------------------------------

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

ans:
    For loop
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)

    While loop
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(i)
        i += 1
----------------------------------------------------------------

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

ans:
    import spam
    spam.bacon()
