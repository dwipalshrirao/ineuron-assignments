1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
'hello';
-87.8
-
/
+
6

ans: 
      i] *            - expression
     ii] 'hello'      - values
    iii]-87.8         - values
     iv] -            - expression
      v] /            - expression
     vi] +            - expression
    vii] 6            - values
-----------------------------------------------------

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

ans:
    A string is a sequence of characters, while a variable is a container a value. 
    A string can be assigned to a variable, and the variable can then be used to refer to the string.
------------------------------------------------------

3. Describe three different data types.

ans:
    The three main data types in Python are:

    * Integer: Whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3.
    * Float: Numbers with decimal points, such as 1.2, 3.14.
    * String: Sequences of characters, such as "hello world".
    There are also other data types in Python, such as 
    * lists: it is itereable datatype which can store multiple values, such as [1, 'banglore', 1.2]
    * tuple: it is same list but it is immutable
    * dictionaries: it stored data in key, value pair ex, {'city':'banglore', 'country': 'india'}
    * sets: it can store unique values only.
------------------------------------------------------

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

ans:
    An expression is a combination of values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value. 
    All expressions do something, such as calculate a value, perform a comparison, or control the flow of 
    a program.
--------------------------------------------------------

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

ans:
    An expression is a combination of values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value. 
    A statement is a complete instruction that tells the computer to do something. In the assignment 
    statement spam = 10, the expression spam = 10 is evaluated and the value 10 is assigned to the 
    variable spam.
--------------------------------------------------------

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

ans:
    bacon = 22, because after doing 'bacon + 1' it is not assigned to 'bacon' variable.
-------------------------------------------------------

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

ans:
    'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'
    'spam' * 3 = 'spamspamspam'
------------------------------------------------------

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

ans:
    Variable names in Python must start with a letter or underscore, and they can only contain letters, 
    numbers, and underscores. The name eggs is valid because it starts with a letter and it only contains 
    letters, numbers, and underscores. The name 100 is invalid because it starts with a number.
-------------------------------------------------------

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

ans:
    The three functions that can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
    version of a value are:

    int(): Converts a value to an integer.
    float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.
    str(): Converts a value to a string.
------------------------------------------------------------

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + 'burritos.'

ans:
    Here 'I have eaten ' and 'burritos.' both are string but 99 is number and python doesn't support 
    concatination of string and integer. To aviod error, we can convert 99 to string format like given below
    'I have eaten ' + str(99) + 'burritos.'
